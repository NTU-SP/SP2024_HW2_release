TODO:
1. Complete Makefile
2. Complete `friend.c`

Reminder:
1. Start homework by running code with `./friend Not_Tako`
2. You may test public testcase by `./friend Not_Tako < input.txt > output.txt`
3. use `diff` or other commands to your advantage.
4. write error code
5. there is not public judge (yet?)
